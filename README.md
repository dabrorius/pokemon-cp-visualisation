[Live version](http://codemonster.co/pokemon-go-visualization/)

This is a scatter diagram displaying a link between maximum 'tankiness' and CP (at level 40) for each non-legendary Pokemon in Pokemon GO. The data was taken from [Battle Calculator](https://battlecalculator.com/pokemon-go/pokemon-go-max-cp-hp).

- Tankiness is calculated by multiplying HP and defense score of a Pokemon
- Hovering over a point will show detailed information about the Pokemon
- Color of a point represents Pokemon's primary type
- You can use the search box to find a specific Pokemon
